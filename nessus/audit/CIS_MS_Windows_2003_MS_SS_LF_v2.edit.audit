The System log collects events generated by the operating system, such as system reboots and a startup or shutdown of event logs. It is important to have a maximum log size set because if the maximum value is reached your system needs to be able to do 1 of the 3 cases. (case 1) overwrite events as needed (case 2) overwrite events by day (case 3) the recommended choice manually deletes events. In cases 1 and 2 an attacker can try to over load your event log file and cause the events the attacker is causing to be overwritten. For example, the attacker can try to log into a disabled guest account multiple times. This can cause the log size to exceed the set max and other events 'important events' will be overwritten by the decoy."

The original LAN Manager (or LM) password hash is considered very weak, but is still used by most Windows 9x clients. Using commercially available software, and off-the-shelf computers, most LM password hashes can be used to reveal the actual password in a matter of days, or hours. After NTLM was released it was found to be not much more secure than its previous version thus NTLMv2 was released. NTLMv2 has significant security improvements to its previous version when combined with a strong password policy. Accounts will be much more secure from brute force attacks."
